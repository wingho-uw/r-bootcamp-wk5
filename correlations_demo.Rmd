### Covariance and correlation

#### Example: noisy quintic curve

Loading the prepared dataset (quintic curve with noise)

```{r}
quintic <- read_csv("data/quintic_data.csv")
```

Plot the location of the data points

```{r}
ggplot(quintic) + geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y)) + coord_fixed()
```

Covariance between x and y

```{r}
cov(quintic$x, quintic$y)
```

Pearson correlation between x and y

```{r}
cor(quintic$x, quintic$y)
```

Spearman's correlation between x and y

```{r}
cor(quintic$x, quintic$y, method="spearman")
```

Full covariance matrix

```{r}

```

Full correlation matrix
